# tic-tac-toe

### This is the classic Tic Tac Toe game made by 2 students, me and Laura. We can play this game in 3 ways : human vs human, human vs AI, AI vs AI. Human can place his bet wherever he wants on empty cells in order to win the game. AI knows how to go for an easy win or how to prevent an easy lose.

### We display messages during the game to see who is next, wether the position is available or who won the game.

### In this project we use all the concepts we have learned so far from variables and operators to nested loops and complex functions.
